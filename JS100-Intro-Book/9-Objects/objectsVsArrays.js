/*
there are so many different way to represent DATA with code

choose [object] or [array] to store data? 
  > do the individual values have [names] or [labels]>
    > yes: object
    > no:  array

does order matter?
  > yes: array
  > no: object

do i need a [stack] or [queue] structure?
  > stack : array
    > arrays are good at simple "last-in-first-out" [stacks]
      and "first=in-first-out" [queues]


[NOTE]:
As you grow as a developer, your familiarity with 
these data structures may affect which one 
you choose to solve a problem.
Practice and experiment with each to 
find out which data structure 
works best in which situations.
